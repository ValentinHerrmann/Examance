# QR stickers and result sharing

Issues #207 and #83. Teachers print QR name stickers for the exam sheets and later give each student their graded PDF through a personal link. The server only ever stores ciphertext it cannot open.

## QR name stickers

- `lib/qr/stickerSheet.ts` (`renderStickerSheet`, `entriesFromRoster`) draws an A4 sheet of 5 × 7 labels with pdf-lib. QR codes are vector modules from the bundled `qrcode` package (`lib/pdf/labelKit.ts` `drawQr`); there is no external QR service, because the CSP allows `script-src 'self'` only.
- The payload is `Lastname, Firstname_ID` (`formatStudentQr` in `utils/studentQr.ts`), which is also the DiRueLei format. `parseStudentQr` reads it back, and the scanner stores the whole text as the student's raw id (`pseudonymRaw`).
- If a pasted line has no id, `stickerId(name)` (`crypto/stickerKey.ts`) derives a stable 6-character id from the name, so a reprint gives the same sticker.
- **Personal key slips.** With the option on, each student gets a key cell after their stickers. The key is `personalKey(raw)`, so it needs no storage. Students who already carry a sticker (made by DiRueLei or an older sheet) can get key slips only, from the exam's students ("print only the key slips").
- `K_sticker = HKDF-SHA-256(data key, salt "examance-sticker-v1", info "sticker")`. Ids and keys are HMACs under it, so only this account can reproduce them, and a reprint always matches.
- Students added by hand or opened from unmatched pages have a minted UUID as their raw id. They carry no sticker, so `stickerRawOf` returns null for them.

## Sharing

The flow lives in `lib/sharing/shareService.ts`:

1. `loadResults` and `forEachGradedPdf` from `export/examExport.ts` render each chosen student's PDF with `renderGradedPdf`. The ZIP export uses the same loop. Results come through the repositories, so sharing works in both storage modes.
2. `shareCrypto.ts` mints a link `/result#<shareId>.<token>` (16 random bytes) and seals the PDF.
3. `api/resultShares.ts` uploads the ciphertext with `POST /exams/{id}/shares`.
4. `slipsPdf.ts` prints one slip per student with the link's QR code.

**Keys.** The link fragment never reaches the server.

| Value | Derivation | Who holds it |
|---|---|---|
| lookup secret | `HKDF(token, salt = shareId, info "examance-share-lookup:v1")` | the student sends it to fetch the ciphertext; the server stores only its SHA-256 (`lookup_hash`) |
| content key, factor `none` | `HKDF(token, salt = shareId, info "examance-share-key:v1:none")` | the link |
| content key, `sticker`/`code` | `HKDF(token ‖ Argon2id(code, kdf_salt), salt = shareId, info "examance-share-key:v1:<factor>")` | link plus code; `kdf_salt` is random and stored with the share |

**Sealing.** AES-256-GCM, AAD `share:v1:<shareId>`. The plaintext is `[u32 header length][header JSON {filename, examTitle}][pdf]`.

**Codes** have 8 characters from the `randomCode` alphabet (32 letters, 40 bits) and are printed as `ABCD-EFGH`. The token carries the security: someone without the link cannot even fetch the ciphertext. The code protects against a forwarded link, and Argon2id makes guessing it offline expensive.

**Factors**, chosen per share in the dialog:
- `none`: the link alone opens the PDF.
- `sticker`: the personal key from the sticker sheet.
- `code`: a fresh code per student, printed on separate code slips so it can be handed out apart from the link. The code is never stored; if one is lost, share that student again.

**Channels.** `lib/sharing/channels.ts` lists how results reach students. Each channel names the factors it carries and which students it cannot reach. The dialog mutes factors that no chosen student can use, and shows the reason (`incompatibleStudents`). Only `slips` exists today. To add e-mail, Artemis or Moodle/Mebis, register a channel there, give it its own delivery step in `shareService`, and add its compatibility rule (for example, Artemis needs a numeric Artemis user id as the sticker id). E-mail can only send the link: the server cannot attach a PDF it cannot read.

## Server

- **Storage.** `result_shares` (`models/result_share.py`, read and written only by `services/result_shares.py`) holds:
  - `student_key`, the student's version-2 pseudonym from `joinKey`, which is stable across a re-key;
  - `lookup_hash`, `factor`, `kdf_salt`, `iv`, the ciphertext and `expires_at`.

  The ciphertext lives in the `shares` blob kind or in the deferred `ciphertext` column, following `BLOB_STORAGE_BACKEND` like scans do.
- **Replacing.** Sharing a student again replaces their row, so the old link dies.
- **Teacher endpoints.** `POST/GET/DELETE /exams/{id}/shares` (`DELETE ?student_key=` revokes one student) and `DELETE /exams/{id}/shares/{share_id}`. They depend on `get_teaching_teacher` and are not gated by `server_results`: the server can never read a share.
- **Public endpoint.** `POST /shares/{id}/open {lookup_b64}` needs no session and is limited to 30/minute per IP. Unknown, expired, revoked and wrong-lookup requests all answer the same `404 ERR_SHARE_NOT_FOUND`.
- **Lifetime.**
  - A teacher picks 7, 14, 30 or 90 days (`RESULT_SHARE_EXPIRY_DAYS`).
  - The retention run deletes expired shares (step 14) and sweeps orphaned files.
  - Deleting an exam deletes its shares outright. They are not captured into the trash, because a restored exam must not revive links.
  - Deleting a student revokes their link: server side for version-2 keys, and from the client in every mode (`studentRepository.delete`), because a hybrid delete never reaches the server.
  - Account deletion drops the files with the cascade.
- **Hybrid accounts.** This is the only path on which result data, as ciphertext only, reaches the server in `hybrid` mode. The dialog says so.

## Student page

`routes/result/+page.svelte` is a public path (`isPublicPath`, exact match `/result`). It runs these steps:

1. Parse the fragment.
2. Derive the lookup and fetch the ciphertext.
3. Ask for the code when the factor needs one.
4. Decrypt in the browser and offer the PDF as a download.

A wrong code fails GCM authentication and shows "key incorrect". The page sets `noindex` and `no-referrer`.
